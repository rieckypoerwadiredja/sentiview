      "body": "I love slow cooker meals, this is just the perfect size to make meals for family of 3. I work from home, i start dinner in the morning and by the time im done work, dinner is ready. Made spinach dip, italian sausage tomato sauce, and korean bulgogi for sunday football. Family dinner was amazing. We all dont like left overs so this 1.5 qt size is perfect. Very satisfied with this product.",
