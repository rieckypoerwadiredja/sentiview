            Saw it on sale for 130$ and for that vaulve i couldn’t pass it up
            works great as a work laptop which is what i bought it for just an
            extra laptop for the buisness. If its on sale definitely go for it,
            screen is dule in color and quality but again if used as a work

            Chromebooks are very budget-friendly machines meant to be bare
            minimum devices that help you complete the basics. There's not much
            that separates one from another. Sure, there are "premium"
            Chromebooks, which have better displays and more powerful processors
            but lack disc drives, graphics cards, or other features that would
            have it compete with an all-out laptop. This 14" HP Chromebook
            (model 14a-ne1013dx) is the newest "budget-friendly" Chromebook from
            HP. Costing $319, it's not expensive, but not as cheap as other
            basic Chromebooks on the market. And that is where I have issues
            with it. There are other HP Chromebooks that you can buy for less
            than $200. Those offer the same features as this one. HP lists this
            one as featuring "budget" everything: processor, graphics, and
            system memory. The screen is LCD and sports a 1366 x 768 resolution.
            These are all very bottom-of-the-barrel specs. This forces me to
            recommend not going with this model but a cheaper one if you are
            going for a basic Chromebook. The differences are not worth an
            additional hundred. I may be spoiled by having a Pixelbook, which
            was released in 2017 and still holds up in 2025. That model can be
            considered a "premium" Chromebook, with a higher MSRP ($550) when
            released, but the differences are night and day from this HP
            Chromebook released in 2025. The first thing I noticed was the lack
            of a screen. Whether it's the LCD or the resolution, the screen
            lacks punch, and the text isn't sharp. Using the device feels like
            you've taken a time machine back to 2016. However, the more I
            thought about it, the more I understood that this device wasn't made
            for someone like me. Sure, I love to write, and this is perfect to
            throw in a bag and travel with when all I want to do is write. But I
            have a lovely laptop, which can also do other things. No, this
            Chromebook is for a student. And it costs in tune with what a school
            could purchase at wholesale for an entire class. Or parents buying
            their child's very first "laptop." Something that will do the basics
            - type, photoshop, slideshows, YouTube, Netflix, etc. It's fast
            enough not to be challenging to work with, so it's very easy to use.
            That's precisely what I'm doing with it. My kid is stoked that he
            doesn't need me to set up my laptop or desktop so he can play
            Scratch or Prodigy. He's happy, and I'm so glad. In the end, that's
            all that matters. That's worth $319.

Sure, there are \"premium\" Chromebooks, which have better displays and more powerful processors but lack disc drives, graphics cards, or other features that would have it compete with an all-out laptop. \n\nThis 14\" HP Chromebook (model 14a-ne1013dx) is the newest \"budget-friendly\" Chromebook from HP. Costing $319, it's not expensive, but not as cheap as other basic Chromebooks on the market. And that is where I have issues with it. \n\nThere are other HP Chromebooks that you can buy for less than $200. Those offer the same features as this one. HP lists this one as featuring \"budget\" everything: processor, graphics, and system memory. The screen is LCD and sports a 1366 x 768 resolution. These are all very bottom-of-the-barrel specs. This forces me to recommend not going with this model but a cheaper one if you are going for a basic Chromebook. The differences are not worth an additional hundred. \n\nI may be spoiled by having a Pixelbook, which was released in 2017 and still holds up in 2025. That model can be considered a \"premium\" Chromebook, with a higher MSRP ($550) when released, but the differences are night and day from this HP Chromebook released in 2025.  \n\nThe first thing I noticed was the lack of a screen. Whether it's the LCD or the resolution, the screen lacks punch, and the text isn't sharp. Using the device feels like you've taken a time machine back to 2016. \n\nHowever, the more I thought about it, the more I understood that this device wasn't made for someone like me. Sure, I love to write, and this is perfect to throw in a bag and travel with when all I want to do is write. But I have a lovely laptop, which can also do other things. No, this Chromebook is for a student. And it costs in tune with what a school could purchase at wholesale for an entire class. Or parents buying their child's very first \"laptop.\" Something that will do the basics - type, photoshop, slideshows, YouTube, Netflix, etc. It's fast enough not to be challenging to work with, so it's very easy to use. \n\nThat's precisely what I'm doing with it. My kid is stoked that he doesn't need me to set up my laptop or desktop so he can play Scratch or Prodigy. He's happy, and I'm so glad. In the end, that's all that matters. That's worth $319.",

            HP Chrome 14a-ne1013dx Laptop : 14" Chromebook - Intel Celeron - 4GB
            Memory - 64GB eMMC. This 2025 version of HP’s well regarded
            Chromebook contributes to HP’S reputation for solidly built, nicely
            designed and good performing laptop. As expected, the Chrome
            operating system is easy to use, secure. and can access an immense
            library of applications. The important stuff is all here. And the
            decisions HP has made makes this 14” portable inviting for
            professionals looking to simplify their lives and students wanting
            to minimize the effort to do research, manage assignments and
            lighten their expenses. SETUP takes only minutes, requiring the
            usual network name and password (WiFi 6 is available), and it asks
            if you’ll be adding an existing Google eMail account or creating a
            new one. Without these you get only guest privileges. You can also
            simplify set up of your new laptop using personal info on your
            android phone. The account and a new device also allows a default
            amount of free storage, ensuring your files are safe and accessible
            from anywhere. Ports available on this HP 14” laptop include on the
            right side a USB-C port which also doubles as the charging port (45
            watt power supply brick included), a USB-A port and a
            headphone/microphone jack. The left side includes an HDMI 1.4b
            output (for supplemental external monitor) and another USB Type-A
            port. Wireless access is available with that Wi-Fi 6 radio and
            Bluetooth.The laptop casework is a substantial and textured recycled
            plastic case. It has a very nice feel. USER EXPERIENCE: I may be an
            unusual Chromebook user in that I am here for the unique utility
            Apps I can get from the Play Store, simple writing Apps for the
            short-form reporting I do, and the extended time I might use the HP
            for a supplemental screen for viewing sporting events. As a computer
            user, with only intermittent use, it is nice to have a device that
            is easy to familiarize myself with quickly and just as easily pick
            it up again a week later and everything still feels intuitive. The
            Keyboard is comfortable, reliable, with a predictable feel with the
            track pad having the same description. But, I’d like to emphasize to
            the HP folks, I rely on those key labels and the contrast is far too
            low for my aging eyes. Backlighting is ideal, but more contrast is a
            huge help. I had no trouble loading in a VPN (SurfShark), my
            favorite alternate browsers (although they may display like a tablet
            or phone layout) and all types of media apps. Everything works with
            little fuss. The screen was my least favorite element in this
            laptop, because this LED design had a tunnel-like window of
            colorfulness and contrast. When I was seated with the screen
            carefully set directly in front of me, it was very nice. But I guess
            I move a lot in front of my computer, and I also try to view media
            from the side. Those two behaviors can make getting the best image
            difficult with this screen technology. Emphasis should be on my bad
            viewing behavior, so my experience will be unique. Audio is average,
            certainly serviceable for YouTube videos and sports events, but
            definitely not adequate for movies or music. Get good earbuds or
            headphones or a desktop system if this is important to you. Battery
            life was very good. I’ve wandered around my home for hours, closed
            up without shutting down, and continued my activities for a few
            days, off and on, with little lots of battery life to spare. I was
            especially surprised by the usefulness of what might seem like
            limited memory and storage. Chrome OS and the related Apps are very
            efficient, allowing for multiple Apps to be open and several windows
            active without slowing down my work. That’s a nice surprise. And, of
            course, Google offers reliable, secure storage on the cloud for
            free, and much more can be purchased for reasonable fees. SUMMARY:
            I’ll repeat myself. The HP Chromebook is a nice surprise. It has no
            bad behaviors and does nothing to remind you it’s a basic computing
            device. It does the important stuff well. And by important, I mean
            it is the ideal Web terminal, it provides access to a library of
            media, tools, utilities, limitless storage on the cloud, and
            authoring software, all while demanding little effort on my part,
            little expense and few compromises. I can recommend the HP Chrome
            Laptop.

            I’m fairly impressed with both the Chrome OS platform and the
            performance and quality of the HP hardware I’m reviewing. The HP 14
            Chromebook has a gorgeous design that looks like a normal business
            laptop. The grey color scheme looks great, and the quality of the
            finish competes with mid-grade Windows OS laptop. Despite using
            somewhat low spec processor, RAM and memory capacity, the
            performance is still pretty good due to the excellence of the Chrome
            OS platform. That is because the Chrome OS relies on using cloud
            computing technology, which makes it very efficient in optimizing
            limited on-board system resources. If you are an Android phone user,
            you would feel right at home with the Chrome OS user interface. The
            downside to cloud computing tech is that local storage is not a
            priority, so subscription to Google One services, while it’s not
            required, would enhance user’s experience greatly as it would solve
            the problem of having limited local storage. As is, the 64GB on
            board eMMC storage is ample of capacity to download and install many
            apps from the Google Play store. The build quality is good. The
            laptop uses durable material. The monitor hinge seems durable enough
            and the monitor can even lay flat on the table. Despite its 14-inch
            form factor, the laptop still feels light enough. Screen quality is
            typical of what you would expect from any laptop within the same
            price range. It’s useable and will do the job just fine. However,
            colors are muted, and the viewing angle is limited. It has plenty of
            brightness, which I really like. Bottom line is, I need to remind
            myself that this Chromebook is what one should expect from a laptop
            that sits at the upper entry level/ bottom price range. In terms of
            user experience, I enjoy using this Chromebook. Chrome OS comes with
            built-in anti-virus and malware protection so in most cases one does
            not need to pay for an internet security subscription. Audio is loud
            enough so streaming videos from Youtube is an enjoyable experience.
            The audio is good for listening to podcasts with ample volume and
            sufficient clarity, but the speakers are typical entry level ones,
            so music listening is not as enjoyable experience. Since this is a
            Chromebook, the preferred business app is Google workspace although
            you can still work with Microsoft Office through its web browser
            application. Importing your MS Office files to Google workspace apps
            is as easy as uploading all your files to your google drive. The
            Chromebook comes pre-installed with Google workspace so there is no
            need to install the mobile app version from the Google Play store.
            Although the laptop uses Intel Celeron, there is enough processing
            power for the Chrome OS to make user experience enjoyable for both
            business and entertainment. There is a front facing camera for video
            conferencing and again, the image quality is what one should expect
            from an entry level laptop. Battery life is also good, typical of
            Chrome OS laptops. I’m impressed with the availability of
            connectivity options and the wide range of ports. Of course it has
            Wifi and Bluetooth, but the fact that the laptop has both USB-C and
            USB-A as well as audio jack and HDMI port is just awesome. There’s
            plenty of connectivity options there, ready for both business and
            entertainment. Bottom line is this is a great Chromebook for those
            who know what to expect from a Chrome OS machine at the given price
            range. This Chromebook is a massive upgrade from the ones kids use
            in public school. Like: Great design and look Chrome OS rocks User
            experience of a normal business laptop Plenty of connectivity
            options Don’t like: Muted color display Limited viewing angle

            This HP 14-inch Chromebook has an Intel Celeron N4500 processor,
            offers solid performance for everyday computing tasks. This
            lightweight machine excels at web browsing, efficiently handling
            Gmail and other Google services. Google Docs runs smoothly, making
            it suitable for students and professionals who primarily work with
            web-based documents. The 4GB of RAM proves adequate for these tasks
            without noticeable slowdown. Surprisingly, this Chromebook handles
            streaming video content exceptionally well. It manages 4K YouTube
            videos without buffering issues or frame drops. The 14-inch
            micro-edge display is also of decent quality for a Chromebook,
            making it an excellent option for media consumption despite its
            modest specifications. Look, I’m not saying I’m going to be watching
            my Dolby Atmos movie collection on this, but for simple YouTube
            videos like a recipe I want to follow along in the kitchen this
            display is fine. The 64GB eMMC storage is limited but sufficient for
            Chrome OS’s cloud-focused nature. The grey finish gives it a
            professional appearance. Battery life is respectable, typically
            lasting through a full day of intermittent use. The keyboard is
            comfortable for typing sessions, although it doesn’t match the
            comfort of premium models. The trackpad is just ok, not bad but not
            great either. For users seeking an affordable and reliable device
            for web-centric tasks, this Chromebook strikes a good balance
            between performance and price. It’s definitely on the higher end of
            Chromebooks compared to the underpowered ones I’ve used in the past,
            which were not pleasant to use. However, it’s not suitable for
            gaming or tasks that require significant CPU and GPU horsepower,
            such as photography and video editing. Keep in mind this only has
            Intel UHD graphics. If you go in knowing this you won’t be
            disappointed with this laptop.

However, it’s not suitable for gaming or tasks that require significant CPU and GPU horsepower, such as photography and video editing. Keep in mind this only has Intel UHD graphics. If you go in knowing this you won’t be disappointed with this laptop.",

            Having teenagers that require Chromebooks for school, I thought that
            the HP 14" Chromebook would be adequate for their basic school
            needs. I was not looking for the top of the line models that use
            Chromebook Plus, just a basic Chromebook. Well, this is exactly what
            I wanted and not in a good way. This HP 14" Chromebook meets all of
            your basic needs. From the design to the operations, don't expect
            this to wow you or expect this to handle multi-tasking skills well.
            Yet at the same time, knowing that my needs were what they were,
            this was a great choice for what I needed it to do: basic school
            work for the kids, using Google suite, and having a portable device
            with a keyboard attached without the worry of this getting damaged.
            The design is your average clamshell look. With the overall gray
            colors and this nice brushed finish around the keyboard, it looks
            really good. Having legacy USB-A ports along with 1 USB-C port was
            good, although it would have been nice having 2 USB-C and 1 USB-A.
            It also has an HDMI port so you can attach this to any external
            monitor. The bezels around the screen are not too wide where it
            looks dated. I was amazed at the screen quality of this device.
            Images and texts were very crisp and clear, vibrant colors. Yes, it
            is not OLED but we are able to read our texts easily and without any
            eyes strain due to low quality even though it is 1366x768 HD. I
            would have liked for this to have been touchscreen. Operations side,
            this does what we need it for. We have full utilization of the
            Google suite so using Docs, Slides, gmail, Google Drive, etc are all
            easily available. And having the Google Play Store provides us with
            all Android apps, but you are limited to just 64gbs of internal
            storage. As all Chromebooks, they expect you to save everything on
            the cloud but 64gbs in 2025 is just ridiculous, the standard should
            have been twice that at 128gbs. Despite that, I did not notice any
            lagging even with a dozen tabs opened. Only when I had the YouTube
            app running did I notice some hiccups. That's when you start to see
            this struggling due to the 4Gb of RAM and the Celeron processor at
            work. Despite these short comings, we have been impressed with how
            this has been for us for both work and School. The kids are able to
            get their projects on this, and I can utilize the apps from the
            Google Play Store. I would have liked for this to have double the
            storage or at least a microSD card. Just be aware of your needs and
            expectations.

Yet at the same time, knowing that my needs were what they were, this was a great choice for what I needed it to do: basic school work for the kids, using Google suite, and having a portable device with a keyboard attached without the worry of this getting damaged. \n\nThe design is your average clamshell look. With the overall gray colors and this nice brushed finish around the keyboard, it looks really good. Having legacy USB-A ports along with 1 USB-C port was good, although it would have been nice having 2 USB-C and 1 USB-A. It also has an HDMI port so you can attach this to any external monitor. The bezels around the screen are not too wide where it looks dated. \n\nI was amazed at the screen quality of this device. Images and texts were very crisp and clear, vibrant colors. Yes, it is not OLED but we are able to read our texts easily and without any eyes strain due to low quality even though it is 1366x768 HD. I would have liked for this to have been touchscreen. \n\nOperations side, this does what we need it for. We have full utilization of the Google suite so using Docs, Slides, gmail, Google Drive, etc are all easily available. And having the Google Play Store provides us with all Android apps, but you are limited to just 64gbs of internal storage. As all Chromebooks, they expect you to save everything on the cloud but 64gbs in 2025 is just ridiculous, the standard should have been twice that at 128gbs. Despite that, I did not notice any lagging even with a dozen tabs opened. Only when I had the YouTube app running did I notice some hiccups. That's when you start to see this struggling due to the 4Gb of RAM and the Celeron processor at work. \n\nDespite these short comings, we have been impressed with how this has been for us for both work and School. The kids are able to get their projects on this, and I can utilize the apps from the Google Play Store. I would have liked for this to have double the storage or at least a microSD card. Just be aware of your needs and expectations.",

            The HP Chromebook is functional. That is really the best compliment
            I can give it. It is not fancy. But, if you are in the market for a
            Chromebook, then HP has provided a no-frills model that gets the job
            done. The screen is serviceable. There is barely enough storage and
            RAM. The machine will not be winning any points for style or
            performance. But it works. And, sometimes, that is enough. Setup:
            Inside the box, you get the Chromebook, the 45W USB-C power adapter,
            and a brief startup pamphlet. Setup is straightforward. After
            charging and performing first time setup, you will be up and running
            in a matter of minutes. I did not have any software or firmware
            updates waiting for me to install. Experience: At this price, it is
            difficult to nitpick the experience. Users should know this is a
            1080p display that can appear a bit washed out. Colors are not as
            vivid as I would like, but I never struggled to read or watch videos
            on the screen. Colors felt a bit off, but never terribly so. But HP
            has included a HDMI port. You could hook the Chromebook up to an
            external monitor if you wished. With only 64GB of internal storage,
            there is not a lot of storage. My unit did not come with a SD or
            MicroSD card slot. So, unless you want to use USB-A flash drives,
            your storage will be a bit limited. The only USB-C port is powering
            and charging the Chromebook. There is a headphone jack. The webcam
            has a privacy shutter. There are internal speakers. I cannot say
            that I was terribly impressed with the speakers, but, again, they do
            work, and I had no problem understanding videos or listening to
            music. The textured keys on the keyboard are nice and responsive.
            The trackpad is responsive and functional. The unit is not light. It
            was heavier than I expected. I still have some qualms with the
            Chromebook experience. There are apps, but many of them tend to be
            apps that are designed more for the Android phone or tablet
            experience. For instance, you can watch videos on the MAX
            application, but not in full screen for some reason. If you want to
            watch videos on Disney+ or MAX, your best bet is to use the web
            browser. Microsoft has Android apps for the suite of Office
            applications, but if you want to use Office on a Chromebook, you
            need to do so through the web browser. So, on one hand, I wish the
            unit had more storage, but, on the other hand, if everything is done
            over Chrome, storage may not matter all that much. My biggest
            nitpick comes from the 4GB of RAM and the Celeron processor. I
            noticed significant slowdowns when trying to multitask or view more
            intensive websites. Everything still worked, but the Celeron
            processor and the 4GB of RAM definitely seemed to be taxed at times
            and the machine could stutter a bit to keep up. Conclusion: The
            machine is functional. If your kid needs a Chromebook for school,
            this machine should get the job done. For that reason, I am
            confident in recommending it. It will not impress anyone in terms of
            style or functionality, but it will get the job done. And,
            sometimes, that is enough. 4/5

          "name": "HP - 14\" Chromebook - Intel Celeron - 4GB Memory - 64GB eMMC - Modern Grey"

        "reviewBody": "The HP Chromebook is functional. That is really the best compliment I can give it. It is not fancy. But, if you are in the market for a Chromebook, then HP has provided a no-frills model that gets the job done. The screen is serviceable. There is barely enough storage and RAM. The machine will not be winning any points for style or performance. But it works. And, sometimes, that is enough.\n\nSetup: Inside the box, you get the Chromebook, the 45W USB-C power adapter, and a brief startup pamphlet. Setup is straightforward. After charging and performing first time setup, you will be up and running in a matter of minutes. I did not have any software or firmware updates waiting for me to install.\n\nExperience: At this price, it is difficult to nitpick the experience. Users should know this is a 1080p display that can appear a bit washed out. Colors are not as vivid as I would like, but I never struggled to read or watch videos on the screen. Colors felt a bit off, but never terribly so. But HP has included a HDMI port. You could hook the Chromebook up to an external monitor if you wished.\n\nWith only 64GB of internal storage, there is not a lot of storage. My unit did not come with a SD or MicroSD card slot. So, unless you want to use USB-A flash drives, your storage will be a bit limited. The only USB-C port is powering and charging the Chromebook. \n\nThere is a headphone jack. The webcam has a privacy shutter. There are internal speakers. I cannot say that I was terribly impressed with the speakers, but, again, they do work, and I had no problem understanding videos or listening to music.\n\nThe textured keys on the keyboard are nice and responsive. The trackpad is responsive and functional. \n\nThe unit is not light. It was heavier than I expected.\n\nI still have some qualms with the Chromebook experience. There are apps, but many of them tend to be apps that are designed more for the Android phone or tablet experience. For instance, you can watch videos on the MAX application, but not in full screen for some reason. If you want to watch videos on Disney+ or MAX, your best bet is to use the web browser.\n\nMicrosoft has Android apps for the suite of Office applications, but if you want to use Office on a Chromebook, you need to do so through the web browser.\n\nSo, on one hand, I wish the unit had more storage, but, on the other hand, if everything is done over Chrome, storage may not matter all that much.\n\nMy biggest nitpick comes from the 4GB of RAM and the Celeron processor. I noticed significant slowdowns when trying to multitask or view more intensive websites. Everything still worked, but the Celeron processor and the 4GB of RAM definitely seemed to be taxed at times and the machine could stutter a bit to keep up.\n\nConclusion: The machine is functional. If your kid needs a Chromebook for school, this machine should get the job done. For that reason, I am confident in recommending it.  It will not impress anyone in terms of style or functionality, but it will get the job done. And, sometimes, that is enough. 4\u002F5",

            The HP 14a-ne1013dx Chromebook is a fairly basic but still highly
            functional Chromebook. None of its specs will wow you, yet ChromeOS
            is light enough that everything still feels very snappy and
            responsive. Indeed, ChromeOS’s limitations for intense production
            work makes packing a Chromebook with high-end multicore CPUs a bit
            of a waste. Still, there are a few “luxuries” I wish this Chromebook
            had, nonetheless. Like most Chromebooks, setup out of the box is
            super simple. If you are an Android user, it’s even easier–you can
            use it to transfer your WiFi and Google credentials, making setup
            even smoother. You can be up and running in mere minutes. The device
            itself is made of plastic, with the out-facing areas covered in a
            textured plastic that resists showing fingerprints. Opening it up,
            the plastic is smooth but with a faint pattern of vertical lines to
            give it a more visually interesting look. The screen is surrounded
            by very dark gray, almost black, plastic bezels. While it’s a 14”
            screen, it is almost the same size as the most svelte 15” devices
            you might find, but the chassis is still lightweight. The
            non-backlit keyboard is acceptably comfortable to type on, with a
            generously sized but not huge trackpad beneath it. There isn’t a
            number pad, so keep that in mind if you’re a Google Sheets
            aficionado. The screen itself is 1366x768, which just crosses the
            threshold of being HD, and is about the lowest I would accept on a
            14” screen. It’s acceptable enough for most casual uses though, and
            the viewing angles aren’t bad. Above the screen in the upper bezel
            you’ll find the webcam along with a slider for a privacy cover.
            Around the sides you’ll find two USB ports on the right side–a Type
            A port and a Type C port that doubles as the charging port for the
            45W adapter. On the left side you’ll find another Type A USB port,
            the Kensington lock, and an HDMI port. Keep in mind that this is an
            HDMI 1.4 port, so if you’re connecting to a UHD TV you’ll be capped
            at 30Hz. Under the hood, so to speak, you’ll find an Intel Celeron
            N4500, a 2-core/2-thread CPU built for the mobile device market.
            It’s backed by just 4GB of RAM, but again, remember that ChromeOS is
            built for just such chips–it feels subjectively much faster than its
            modest specs suggest. Browsing the web, watching Youtube videos,
            working in Google Docs–all of these are plenty snappy, and remember
            one of the virtues here is that this translates to having great
            battery life. And although ChromeOS is a cloud-oriented OS, there’s
            a relatively generous 64GB of eMMC storage included as well.
            Overall, this is a perfectly serviceable Chromebook for most day to
            day tasks. There are a few features I wish it had–HDMI 2.0, full HD
            resolution, or perhaps a backlit keyboard–but as is it’ll definitely
            serve its intended purpose. I think anyone looking for an
            inexpensive computing device would be happy with this HP Chromebook.

None of its specs will wow you, yet ChromeOS is light enough that everything still feels very snappy and responsive. Indeed, ChromeOS’s limitations for intense production work makes packing a Chromebook with high-end multicore CPUs a bit of a waste. Still, there are a few “luxuries” I wish this Chromebook had, nonetheless.\n\nLike most Chromebooks, setup out of the box is super simple. If you are an Android user, it’s even easier–you can use it to transfer your WiFi and Google credentials, making setup even smoother. You can be up and running in mere minutes.\n\nThe device itself is made of plastic, with the out-facing areas covered in a textured plastic that resists showing fingerprints. Opening it up, the plastic is smooth but with a faint pattern of vertical lines to give it a more visually interesting look. The screen is surrounded by very dark gray, almost black, plastic bezels. While it’s a 14” screen, it is almost the same size as the most svelte 15” devices you might find, but the chassis is still lightweight.\n\nThe non-backlit keyboard is acceptably comfortable to type on, with a generously sized but not huge trackpad beneath it. There isn’t a number pad, so keep that in mind if you’re a Google Sheets aficionado. The screen itself is 1366x768, which just crosses the threshold of being HD, and is about the lowest I would accept on a 14” screen. It’s acceptable enough for most casual uses though, and the viewing angles aren’t bad. Above the screen in the upper bezel you’ll find the webcam along with a slider for a privacy cover. \n\nAround the sides you’ll find two USB ports on the right side–a Type A port and a Type C port that doubles as the charging port for the 45W adapter. On the left side you’ll find another Type A USB port, the Kensington lock, and an HDMI port. Keep in mind that this is an HDMI 1.4 port, so if you’re connecting to a UHD TV you’ll be capped at 30Hz. \n\nUnder the hood, so to speak, you’ll find an Intel Celeron N4500, a 2-core\u002F2-thread CPU built for the mobile device market.

            Very nice Chromebook. It comes well packaged and they include a
            power brick, a type C USB charging cable and a quick instructions
            leaflet. It charges via the type C USB port and it has a status LED
            next to it. Setting it up was easy. Being a Google ecosystem, you
            need google account, but its way easier to setup if you also have an
            Android based phone, if you do, it gives you the option to set up
            the Chromebook using your phone. They pair via Bluetooth and your
            Google account info is transferred and setup on the laptop. Very
            easy. Hardware wise, its made of a nice textured plastic. The screen
            is bright, although has some narrow viewing angles, so you have to
            be looking at the screen straight up for better clarity. They
            keyboard is very responsive and its your classic chiclet type
            keycaps, a little con is that they are not backlit (not even one
            single color), so it may be hard to see if you are trying to type on
            low light or in a dark room. The touchpad is very responsive and it
            has regular USB ports, so I also plugged a generic USB mouse and it
            worked just fine. The speakers are good enough for this type of
            laptop. The Celeron CPU and the generous 4 GB RAM (plenty enough for
            a OS like ChromeOS that is super light and not bloated like other
            OSes) makes it snappy opening and closing apps. I only noticed a
            little bit of slow down when I had a large amount of tabs opened on
            Chrome, but that is it. It also has a front web cam and a privacy
            shutter that slides over it should you chose to. Its a very useful
            Chromebook for home use or a student, it wont break the bank and its
            plenty enough for daily use for me. Battery life has been good, but
            I charge it every night when going to bed. If you need a laptop for
            school or just for light home use, It will work great!

            It’s nice to see a full sized, well built, Chromebook on the market
            for such a reasonable price. I've been using it for a few days now
            and haven’t been disappointed. In its class, it has a nice overall
            build, with decent IO, and a bright screen. First off, this
            Chromebook has a modern look and seems sturdy for its price range.
            The build quality is surprisingly good. It’s plastic, make no
            mistake, with some lid and keyboard flex. For a low cost Chromebook,
            it manages to feel lightweight but solid. The design feels
            contemporary, and it would be perfect for tossing in a backpack
            without worrying too much about dings and dents. Performance wise,
            the Intel Celeron processor paired with 4GB of memory and 64GB of
            eMMC storage gets the job done for everyday tasks, but it does have
            moments of sluggishness. Especially when installing apps, running
            updates, and working with high Chrome tab counts. Web browsing,
            streaming videos, and working on documents are decent experiences.
            If you're a student or someone who needs a reliable machine for
            basic tasks, this Chromebook excels. The battery life is the star
            here. I can go through almost a whole day of casual use before
            needing to charge. There are a few caveats. 4GB of memory can be
            limiting if you try to run multiple heavy apps/tab numbers at once.
            Don’t expect to do any serious multitasking or gaming on this
            machine. Also, 64GB of eMMC storage fills up quick and handles write
            tasks slower than you’d expect. Compared to other Chromebooks in
            this class, the HP 14a-ne1013dx holds its own pretty well. It’s
            cheaper than some other options and if you can catch it on sale,
            it’s a great deal. The keyboard is comfy to type on and the screen,
            while not the highest resolution, is clear and bright enough for
            everyday use. If you need an affordable, reliable Chromebook for
            basic tasks, the HP 14a-ne1013dx is a solid choice. It won't replace
            a high end laptop, but for the price, it offers good value and
            dependable performance.

            I opted for this Chromebook becuase of Google's recent strides with
            Gemini and their Alphabet of applications. it's a great value and
            super stinking light to carry. I've got some gaming PCs and they are
            hefty. The Chromebook isn't going to be heavy but it packs quite a
            bit. First off, it's quick and the wi-fi chip makes it super fast
            and easy to use and from opening the box to plugging it in, it took
            about 3-5 minutes to get up and running. It is important to know
            that you'll need a Google account to allow you to take full
            advantage of the Chrombook. The design is pretty sleek and standard
            for an HP computer. The light matte gray color goes with everything
            and there aren't jarring etched out edges or rough edges either like
            other PCs which can sometimes get caught in your bag. The 14 inch
            screen is perfect for watching your movies or streaming services.
            The resolution isn't anything to write home about but if you have a
            great internet connection it is more than great for a computer that
            you're going to use for daily tasks. I wouldn't recommend it for
            intense movies or games. The top three things I loved after some
            time wtih it were: quick charging with USB-C, the large screen, and
            how light the laptop is. The long term pitfall for me was the memory
            becuase I can see myself filling this up really quick with files and
            photos but these days exteral hard drives are an awesome accessory
            to keep on hand. Overall, a great laptop for daily tasks, and
            probably great use for a young student or college student. The
            combination of HP and Google's technology partnership makes for a
            strong piece of technology for my house!

            No matter what, when you open a laptop or Chromebook for the first
            time, you instinctively look at how to turn it on—and better yet,
            charge it. Now, Chromebooks aren’t meant to be the be-all and
            end-all media center or high end PC replacement, but they’re made to
            be practical and minimalistic and offer a small window of ability to
            do work on the go, and that’s what I’ll be basing my review on:
            simplicity, convenience, and practicality. Super simple—it comes
            with a 45-watt USB-C charger. It has only one USB-C port, so if
            you’re looking to transfer files fast, this is not your go-to. But
            who uses Chromebooks for data transfer unless it’s something small
            like a home video? This unit only has 64 GB of eMMC storage, so
            storage and transfer use are out of the question unless it’s
            documents that require a lesser amount of storage. There are also
            two USB ports, one on each side, so that’s wonderful. I’m just used
            to computers having more than one Type-C port. For everyday use,
            it’s fast—whether you’re browsing the internet or just doing some
            quick research. This is especially good if you’re already integrated
            with Google’s slew of apps and services. This is your all-in-one
            Google-centered hub. The texture of the ridges and plastic feels
            nice in your hand; it gives it a good grip as well. I think it
            provides a comfortable hold. It’s relatively light, and the keyboard
            is very simple, but I must say the feel is nothing like the outside
            of the Chromebook. The keyboard feels like a regular run-of-the-mill
            plastic keyboard. I mean, it’s not the most expensive-feeling one,
            but it gets the job done. Overall, I use it for on-the-go Word and
            Excel, as well as some online research. It’s a great Chromebook with
            a bright screen. The only downside is that I have a hard time typing
            with my big sausage fingers at night. It may be an issue with my own
            hands, but it would be nice to have some sort of backlit keyboard.
            But I digress—I may be asking for too much out of a Chromebook, but
            I’m just thinking about the extra help for people like me, and it
            would be great to have. I’d recommend this. It’s fast, and there are
            so many uses for it.

It’s a great Chromebook with a bright screen. The only downside is that I have a hard time typing with my big sausage fingers at night. It may be an issue with my own hands, but it would be nice to have some sort of backlit keyboard. But I digress—I may be asking for too much out of a Chromebook, but I’m just thinking about the extra help for people like me, and it would be great to have. I’d recommend this. It’s fast, and there are so many uses for it.",
