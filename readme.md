Sentiview is a sentiment analysis system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP), designed to help business owners uncover the true performance of their products by analyzing customer comments—beyond just numerical ratings. By automatically processing thousands of product reviews from e-commerce platforms, Sentiview provides deeper and more accurate insights for both business evaluation and competitor analysis.

# 📌 Project Overview

Today, many online businesses rely solely on star ratings as a measure of product performance. However, ratings can often be misleading. For example:

- A 5-star review may contain negative feedback ("good because it’s cheap, but the taste is bland").

- A low rating might reflect issues unrelated to the product itself (e.g., slow delivery, unfriendly courier).

Moreover, the sheer volume of customer reviews makes it difficult for business owners to manually process them one by one. As a result, crucial insights—such as product strengths, weaknesses, or customer sentiment—are often missed.

# ❗ Key Problems Addressed

- ❌ Star ratings are not always reliable performance indicators

- 🧾 Too many customer reviews to analyze manually

- 📉 Difficult to evaluate competitors or identify product differentiation

- 🤷‍♂️ No structured mapping of customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)

# ✅ Sentiview’s Solution

- Automated scraping of product reviews from e-commerce platforms

- Sentiment classification using NLP to identify positive, negative, and neutral comments

- Support for export in .pkl (Python) and .json (TensorFlow.js) formats

- Visual analysis of product and competitor performance based on real data—not assumptions

- Saves time and effort by eliminating the need to read reviews one by one

# 💡 Key Benefits for Business Owners

- ### 🎯 Identify Product Issues Accurately

  Sentiview detects recurring negative phrases such as “spoils quickly,” “damaged packaging,” or “taste has changed,” allowing businesses to directly address quality concerns.

- ### 📣 Optimize Marketing & Communication Strategies

  If many customers highlight “aesthetic packaging” as a positive point, this insight can be leveraged in future promotional campaigns.

- ### 📏 Measure Customer Satisfaction More Realistically

  Sentiview goes beyond ratings by analyzing the actual emotions and keywords found in user comments.

- ### 🔍 Detect Emerging Consumer Trends

  Early signals—such as a spike in mentions like “just the right level of spice” or “not too sweet”—can reveal shifts in consumer preferences, helping businesses stay ahead of the curve.

- ### 🧭 Gain Competitor Insights to Sharpen Positioning
  By comparing sentiment data from competitors’ products, businesses can identify gaps, spot competitor weaknesses, and refine their unique value proposition more effectively. This enables strategic differentiation in saturated markets.
